        "- No Need to Define Data Types\n",
        "  - Python automatically figures out the type of data (like numbers or words), so you don’t need to define it every time. That saves time and effort.\n",
        "-  Library Support\n",
        "  - From building websites to analyzing data, there’s a Python library for almost everything—like Django, Flask, Pandas, or TensorFlow.\n",
        "- Used Everywhere\n",
        "  - Companies use Python for websites, automation, data science, AI, games, and much more. It’s everywhere.\n",
        "- Beginner-Friendly\n",
        "  - Many people start with Python because it’s designed to be simple. You don’t need to know everything about programming to write useful Python code.\n",
